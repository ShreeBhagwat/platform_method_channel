## Flutter Platform Channel

This application is an example which will showcase the MethodChannel method used to have a communication between Dart code and Native Android and iOS code.
In this example we will be showing an Alert Dialog Box in our Flutter app which will be called in natively in the respected platform. We will also pass some arguments to native code.
